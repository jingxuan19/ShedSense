Region of interest implementation
Line of interest implementation
Capacity checking
anomaly detection (difference in frame)
    - human detection
----------------------------
Multi-sensor
Different accelerator
----------------------------
Perhaps interesting way to show sparseness of usage of bike shed is to plot change in frames agaisnt time (adjusted for light levels (grayscale?))

DONE!!
connect implementation with Coral Accelerator
