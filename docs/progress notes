Trying to get the pi to stream to my laptop, easier debugging when doing live testing.
X11 Forwarding works
Added option to switch between CPU and TPU
trying to solve preprocessing problem (not a priority)

Try using a record-detect paradigm:
captialising on the sparseness of usage of a bikeshed, record the bikeshed in batches, whilst detecting changes in pixels.
If there is sufficient pixel changes above threshold, start detection on that batch.
Otherwise, overwrite the batch.
Batch? or keep the recording from the change in pixels, would that provide enough information?
Probably need to record some history (eg 30s), tbh can try both
This helps improve framerate
Concept of highest entropy proxy

Implemented MQTT with TTLS
Network bottleneck is quite significant, frames dropped a lot while on discord call

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) for detecting changes between frames
First Test:
    Standard Core
        detection on every frame
        No authentication for MQTT
    5 degrees C
    4h 25min 46s

    22972mWh
Second Test:
    Standard Core
        detection on every frame
        Authentication for MQTT 
    15 degrees C
    9h 29min 27s
    9846mAh
